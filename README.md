User Manual for Alarm Clock
What is the application?
  This application is a GUI alarm clock application through Tkinter. Though complex to code, it is quite simple to actually use the application. This application includes a way for user’s to enter a time in 24 hour format, click a button to set their alarm, and watch as the time is counted within the main python program. When the time set into the alarm is reached, the computer will make a noise and the program is finished.
Basic Guide (Using the Set Your Alarm Button)
  Here is a simple tutorial on how to actually use the program.
  Users will open the program within GitHub, Python, Notebook, etc.
  Alarm clock will appear on screen.
  Users will enter the time in 24 hour format within each individual text entry box labeled, “Hour, Min, Sec”.
  Users will then click the Set your Alarm button.
  The Python program will count the time until the time set into the alarm is reached.
  Computer will play noise to signal that the alarm has been reached. 
  The program is complete.
Using the Exit Button
  If the user wishes to leave the program at any time, they can simply click the “x” in the upper right hand corner as with any regular internet program, or the application has a built-in Exit Button the user is able to use. Simply click on the Button labeled Exit, and the program will close completely. This will also allow the user to completely rid their screen of the application if they wish to do so. 
Using the Thank You Button
  If the user wishes to see the Thank You Button, they can simply click the Button labeled Thank You, and it will open to the second window of the application. This window is mainly to thank the user for using the program. The program will also display that the previous window (the alarm clock) is the main window of use, in case the user is confused on which window is which.
